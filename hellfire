Beata Maria, you know I am a righteous man,
Of my virtue I am justly proud.
Beata Maria, you know I'm so much purer than
The common, vulgar, weak licentious crowd.

Then tell me, Maria, why I see her dancing there,
Why her smouldering eyes still scorch my soul.
I feel her, I see her, the sun caught in her raven hair
Is blazing in me out of all control

Like fire, hellfire,
This fire in my skin,
This burning desire is turning me to sin.

It's not my fault. I'm not to blame!
It is the gypsy girl, the witch who sent this flame!
It's not my fault, if in God's plan,
He made the devil so much stronger than a man!

Protect me, Maria,
Don't let this siren cast her spell,
Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone.
Destroy Esmeralda,
And let her taste the fires of Hell,
Or else let her be mine and mine alone.

Hellfire, dark fire,
Now, gypsy, it's your turn.
Choose me or your pyre,
Be mine or you will burn!

God have mercy on her.
God have mercy on me.
But she will be mine or she will burn!
