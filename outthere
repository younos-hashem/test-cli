[FROLLO (QUASIMODO)]
The world is cruel.
The world is wicked.
It's I alone whom you can trust in this whole city.
I am your only friend.

I, who keep you, feed you, teach you, dress you.
I, who look upon you without fear.
How can I protect you boy unless you
Always stay in here?
Away in here.

{spoken}
Remember what I taught you, Quasimodo.

{sung}
You are deformed (I am deformed).
And you are ugly (and I am ugly).
And these are crimes for which the world shows little pity!
You do not comprehend (you're my defender).

Out there they will revile you as a monster.
Out there they will hate, and scorn, and jeer.
Why invite their curses and their consternation?
Stay in here,
Away in here,
Be faithful to me (faithful to you)
Grateful to me (grateful to you)

Do as I say,
Obey,

[BOTH]
And stay in here.

[FROLLO]
{spoken}
Remember, Quasimodo. This is your sanctuary.

[QUASIMODO]
{spoken}
My sanctuary.

{sung}
Safe behind these windows and these parapets of stone,
Gazing at the people down below me.
All my life I watch them as I hide up here alone,
Hungry for the histories they show me.
All my life I memorize their faces,
Knowing them as they will never know me.
ALl my life I wonder how it feels to pass a day,
Not above them, but part of them.

And out there,
Living in the sun.
Give me one day out there,
All I ask is one to hold forever,
Out there,
Where they all live unaware
What I'd give
What I'd dare
Just to live one day out there.

Out there among the millers and the weavers and their wives!
Through the roofs and gables, I can see them.
Every day they shout and scold and go about their lives,
Heedless of the gift it is to be them.
If I were in their skin, I'd treasure every instant out there

Strolling by the Seine,
Taste a morning out there,
Like ordinary men
Who freely walk about there.
Just one day and then
I swear I'll be content
With my share
Won't resent,
Won't despair,
Old and bent,
I won't care.
I'll have spent one day
Out there!
