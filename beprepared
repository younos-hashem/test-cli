[SCAR (HYENAS)]
I know that your powers of retention
Are as wet as a warthog's backside.
But thick as you are, pay attention--
My words are a matter of pride.

It's clear from your vacant expressions
The lights are not all on upstairs.
But we're talking kings and successions--
Even you can't be caught unawares!

So prepare for the chance of a lifetime.
Be prepared for sensational news!
A shining new era is tiptoeing nearer
(And where do we feature?)
Just listen to teacher!

I know it sounds sordid,
But you'll be rewarded
When at last, I am given my dues.
And in justice deliciously squared
Be prepared!

(It's great that we'll soon be connected
With a king who'll be all-time adored)
Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected
To take certain duties on board.
The future is littered with prizes,
And though I'm the main addressee,
The point that I must emphasize is
You won't get a sniff without me!

So prepare for the coup of the century.
Be prepared for the murkiest scam!
Meticulous planning,
Tenacity spanning,
Decades of denial,
Is simply why I'll,
Be king undisputed,
Respected, saluted,
And seen for the wonder I am!
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared--
Be prepared!
(Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared--
Be prepared!)
